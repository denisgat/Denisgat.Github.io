Hey, welcome to my blog. In the blog i will be sharing this blog is being created and my learning through out creating it. This is a work in progress than will continuely change as my skills and abilities in web development improve.

1.  The first step is to create a respository which i did in Github and pushed onto my local harddrive through my linux terminal. 
1. Next i needed to create this README file and a .gitignore file on my local harddrive and then push up into github once again using the terminal.
