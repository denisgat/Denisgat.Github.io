            <br>Hey, i see you found your way to my blog. This is a place where i'll be sharing my journey 
                to becoming a web developer. I will share my good times and my bad while walking you through how i was able to overcome them. 
            </p2></br>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">PREWORK WEEK 1</h3>

            <p>Stack Learned:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Command Line</li>
                <li>Git</li>
                <li>Github</li>
            </ol>

            <p1>
                The first week was excited, similar to the feeling you have right before you dive off a swimming pool diving board i was ready to commit 
                head first. I had to install linux on my windows laptop to access the control line (terminal). Everything i tried would make my computer 
                crash except for virtual box which is what i am using currently with linux version ubuntu 18.02 LTS.   
            </p1>
            <!-- Why can't these two paragraphs seperate? -->
            <p2> The next challenging part of the first week was learning how to utilize terminal commands with respect to repsitory's and directories
                 located on github. This blog helped me further my understanding of how i can utilize these new aspects of web development. I was able 
                 to upload files from my local computer onto github which i am really proud of. Well that's the first week. I hope to keep learning and 
                 involving this blog to show you my continious improvement. 
            </p2>
                 
            <h3  style="text-align:center;">PREWORK WEEK 2</h3>
            <p>Stack Learned:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ol>
            <p1>
                This week i learned how to use HTML. This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started" title="HTML learning" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a> 
                was a great resource for me throughout my learning journey. A challenge i had was visualizing the code i was creating in visual studio code 
                since mamp (an html and code viewer) could not be downloaded on linux i had to find an alternative. Through the gracious help of a classmate
                i was able to use an extension on VSC to see live the webpage that i was creating. I am incredibly exicted about this as it gives me the capability 
                to experiment to my hearts content.
