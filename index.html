                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>
                    Hey, i see you found your way to my blog. This is a place where i'll be sharing my journey
                    to becoming a web developer. I will share my good times and my bad while walking you through how i
                    was
                    able to overcome them.

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <!-- <img src="Command Line" alt="command line image"> -->
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <!-- <img src="Git" alt="git image"> -->
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <!-- <img src="Github" alt="github image"> -->

                </ul>

                <p>
                   This week was more continuel learing of HTML/CSS/JS with an emphasize of JS. 
                </p>

                <p> The next challenging part of the first was comprehending the logic and datatypes that javascript use to reach 
                    its goal. In essense learning to think like a computer. We had three projects we had to accomplish. The image gallary,
                    Digital clock, and Countdown Timer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this program i've noticed that there comes a point when the assignments are giving you too much help. The image 
                    gallery was an example of this. It started with content already provided, but since my understanding of this content was limted
                    i was under the impression that what i was trying to do had no yet been done, leading to me spending hours overthinking things that 
                    were already done and coded. This has happened before but now i had finally understood the correct process to take when met with 
                    this kind of assignment. Firstly lead through the instructions thoroughly and multiple times, then try and relate the provided information
                    with what you already know and what you need to learn. Sadly i still had to resort to getting help in order to overcome this barrier but once 
                    through it was easy sailing.
        
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other two assignments were fairly similar to each other and mainly had to do with the logic side of JS and how JS talks to your
                    HTML file to display the items that you want. It was rather fun and this was a project that i was ready to present.

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <!-- <img src="Git" alt="HTML image"> -->
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <!-- <img src="CSS" alt="CSS image"> -->
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <!-- <img src="JS" alt="JS image" -->
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Programming has a way of humbling a person. I came into this programming with some programming
                    skills knowing that they could be utilized but with every step came an new obstacle that required me to 
                    find a new path to the answer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest AHA moment was finally understanding how the big three work together and reference each other when 
                    calling function, variable, or other objects that it needs. Once i've overcome learning how this works in full, 
                    i believe that my progress with the three programs will really start taking off. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenging item this time around was internalizing how css manipulate the boxes that the content is in.
                    Margin, padding, and display were key items that i had trouble with and had to push through simply by utilizing 
                    chrome dev tools to see how they function and change the content. 
                </p>

                    This week i learned how to use HTML. This <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started"
                    title="HTML learning" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a>
                was a great resource for me throughout my learning journey. A challenge i had was visualizing the code that i
                had creating in visual studio code
                since mamp (an html and code viewer) could not be downloaded on linux i had to find an alternative.
                Through the gracious help of a classmate
                i was able to use an extension on VSC to see live the webpage that i was creating. I am incredibly
                exicted about this as it gives me the capability
                to experiment to my hearts content.

                <ul>
                    <li>Command Line</li>
                    <!-- <img src="Command Line" alt="command line image"> -->

                <p>
                    The first week was excited, similar to the feeling you have right before you dive off a swimming
                    pool
                    diving board i was ready to commit
                    head first. I had to install linux on my windows laptop to access the control line (terminal).
                    Everything i tried would make my computer
                    crash except for virtual box which is what i am using currently with linux version ubuntu 18.02 LTS.
                </p>

                <p> The next challenging part of the first week was learning how to utilize terminal commands with
                    respect
                    to repsitory's and directories
                    located on github. This blog helped me further my understanding of how i can utilize these new
                    aspects
                    of web development. I was able
                    to upload files from my local computer onto github which i am really proud of. Well that's the first
                    week. I hope to keep learning and
                    involving this blog to show you my continious improvement
                </p>
