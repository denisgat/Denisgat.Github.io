            <p1>Hey, i see you found your way to my blog. This is a place where i'll be sharing my journey 
                to becoming a web developer. I will share my good times and my bad while walking you through how i was able to overcome them. 
            </p1>

            <h2>PREWORK WEEK 1</h2>
            <p2>
                The first week was excited, similar to the feeling you have right before you dive off a swimming pool diving board i was ready to commit head first. 
                I had to install linux on my windows laptop to access the control line (terminal). Everything i tried would make my computer crash except for virtual box 
                which is what i am using currently with linux version ubuntu 18.02 LTS.   
            </p2>

            <p3> The next challenging part of the first week was learning how to utilize terminal commands with respect to repsitory's and directories located on github. 
                 This blog helped me further my understanding of how i can utilize these new aspects of web development. I was able to upload files from my local computer 
                 onto github which i am really proud of. Well that's the first week. I hope to keep learning and involving this blog to show you my continious improvement. 
            </p3>
