                Hey, i see you found your way to my blog. This is a place where i'll be sharing my journey
                to becoming a web developer. I will share my good times and my bad while walking you through how i
                was
                able to overcome them.

            </ul>
            <p>
                The first week was excited, similar to the feeling you have right before you dive off a swimming
                pool
                diving board i was ready to commit
                head first. I had to install linux on my windows laptop to access the control line (terminal).
                Everything i tried would make my computer
                crash except for virtual box which is what i am using currently with linux version ubuntu 18.02 LTS.
            </p>

            <p> The next challenging part of the first week was learning how to utilize terminal commands with
                respect
                to repsitory's and directories
                located on github. This blog helped me further my understanding of how i can utilize these new
                aspects
                of web development. I was able
                to upload files from my local computer onto github which i am really proud of. Well that's the first
                week. I hope to keep learning and
                involving this blog to show you my continious improvement
            </p>

                    This week i learned how to use HTML. This <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started"
                        title="HTML learning" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a>
                    was a great resource for me throughout my learning journey. A challenge i had was visualizing the
                    code i
                    was creating in visual studio code
                    since mamp (an html and code viewer) could not be downloaded on linux i had to find an alternative.
                    Through the gracious help of a classmate
                    i was able to use an extension on VSC to see live the webpage that i was creating. I am incredibly
                    exicted about this as it gives me the capability
                    to experiment to my hearts content.

                    The time has come to catch-up. Dawned has the realization come that i will need to focus and
                    understand what is most important
                    to me. My wasted time or the knowledge and growth gained from falling, and falling agian. Naively, i
                    entered this program
                    with a bolstered ego from previous experience with programming. I would sometimes delay assignments
                    and assuming i could knock them out
                    without as much as a dimple on my keyboard. My was i wrong. With each step came an obstacle that
                    required i reach out to the Awesome instructors
                    further bruising my once hawty pride. With this i learned that one must be humbled by each situation
                    and must come determed to excel. If you want
                    strive for greatness then constantly be reaching for it even when your mind tells you to willow in
                    the weeds. Greatness here i come.
